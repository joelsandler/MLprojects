University project to solve the NLP problem of Natural Language Inference (NLI), where NLI is the task of determining whether a “hypothesis” is true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a “premise”.
This project was done in collaboration with Hubert Au and Jay Haran.
